Week 1
Group formed AUNTILTED. Selected Scrum Master as Dhruv. Created the Jira Site. We decided on doing project 7. We set up Jira. 
We looked into the twitter API a bit and we have to pay at least $100USD for it in order to read tweets now using it (thanks Elon). N
ot sure if we can continue with this project at the moment but we have selected Project 10 as an alternative if it isnâ€™t possible. 
Praying that we can do it still (without paying of course).

Week 2
Taking meeting minutes and now the scrum master for the team, Started work on proposal. I'm working on the figma design to work towards
the storyboard component of the proposal.
