Week 1:
We formed our group this week. Had a group meeting to discuss which project we were going to do - I organised the meeting and did some research into a few of the possible projects. Then, looked into the Twitter API for fake news detection and realised it was very expensive. Then I helped look into the other projects and develop an alternative plan if we weren't able to find a way to get the Twitter API.

Week 2:
We decided that we would go with the microservices project P10 instead of the one we had originally chosen because the problems with the Twitter API being too expensive were not resolved. I organised a few meetings to discuss delegating tasks. Because the project we chose has a lot of different moving components and is very client-intensive with discussing requirements, we decided to split up team lead and scrum master and I became team lead instead.

I compiled a list of all the questions we had and designed a basic flowchart so we could better understand the requirements for the project. Then, I attended a meeting with the client, took notes and followed up with the questions we had. Then we started the project planning and user story creation.

I created the document for the proposal and set out the basic skeleton for the first third of the report. Then, we set a soft deadline to fill in the proposal.

Week 3:
We continued the proposal which was due on Friday. We had a good idea of what the project involved and I organised a meeting to ensure that the deadline would be met. We removed the soft deadline as we were sure we would be able to meet the Friday deadline.

I conducted research on the use of microservices in other systems and downloaded some financial datasets to experiment with the feasibility of a stock prediction system. After determining that this would not be too difficult, we added it as an additional microservice to the project.

I wrote the introduction and, with some help, the relevant works section. Additionally, I took detailed notes from the lectures on the requirements for the proposal for our team to use to ensure we met all the criteria needed.
